**Which package does this affect?**

If this covers multiple packages, **if possible** open an issue for both and PR separately: this will keep the PR's scope as small as possible.

- [ ] `@thingco/{PACKAGE_NAME_HERE}`

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the documentation you want here.
