# ThingCo shared frontend libraries

## Overview

A set of public, shared libraries for use in frontend React/React Native-based applications

## Requirements

- **Node**. This is a hard requirement. Ideally use latest stable version, but shouldn't matter too much.
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)**. This is a hard requirement. The project uses features only available in Yarn.
- **[Just](https://github.com/casey/just)**. This is not a hard requirement. Just is a task runner. It's easier to use a task runner than writing bash scripts, and Make is not particularly cross-platform. We aren't doing anything complicated here, it's just easier to collate common commands in one place.
